The dataset includes 893 images.
Medicine_label_obb are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1280x1280 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
